**Last Updated: 2024-02-18**

## Version History

- **1.0 (Created on 2024-02-18)**: Initial release.

## Age Requirement and Parental Approval

You must be at least 13 years old to use KeyVault. If you are under 18, you must have parental approval to create an account and use our services. By agreeing to these terms, you confirm that you meet these age requirements and that, if under 18, you have obtained the necessary parental consent.

## Encryption and Data Storage

KeyVault is meant for storing your data in an encrypted format. For security purposes, the encryption and decryption process must take place off-chain so that no unencrypted data is submitted to the blockchain.

Under correct usage of KeyVault, KeyVault stores only encrypted information on the blockchain. You hold the only key capable of decrypting this information. We do not have access to your encryption key and, therefore, cannot decrypt your credentials or recover them if you lose your key.

Again, you're responsible for encrypting your data before storing it and managing your encryption keys securely. We cannot decrypt or access your data.

## Privacy and Blockchain Transparency

KeyVault does not capture or store any personal information off-chain, even for analytics purposes. However, it's important to remember that this is a blockchain-based application. Consequently, actions such as creating an account, inserting new credentials, or resetting your account are public, recorded on the blockchain, and visible to anyone. While all credentials are encrypted (assuming the user is properly using the provided frontend as intended) before being stored on-chain, ensuring their privacy, the fact that these actions have occurred is public.

## Immutability of Stored Information

Due to the immutable nature of blockchain technology, once information is encrypted and stored on-chain, it cannot be altered or removed. This ensures the integrity and security of your data but also means you should be certain before submitting any information to KeyVault. It is your responsibility to manage the data you choose to store securely.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we, along with our officers, directors, employees, agents, or affiliates, will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of KeyVault. This includes, but is not limited to, any errors or omissions in any content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via KeyVault, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.

This agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Nevada, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You agree that any legal action or proceeding related to KeyVault shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Nevada, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction and venue in such courts.

By using KeyVault, you acknowledge that you have read these terms of service, understand them, and agree to be bound by these limitations of liability.

## No Warranty

Due to the public and immutable nature of blockchains, encryption and decryption must occur off-chain. As this is impossible for us to enforce, we are unable to provide any warranty.

As such, KeyVault is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. We don't guarantee that it will meet your requirements or be available at all times.

## Your Agreement

By using KeyVault, you agree to these terms and conditions. Your use of our service signifies your acceptance of these terms and your commitment to comply with them. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use KeyVault.
